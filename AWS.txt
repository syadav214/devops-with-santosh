1. Create a lambda function
    - enter a name
    - choose runtime as node8
    - choose an existing role such as 
        for dev => authenticator-dev-lambdaRole
        for stage => authenticator-stage-lambdaRole
        for prod => authenticator-prod-lambdaRole

2. Cloud watch
    - you will have policy of eu-west 
    - add VPC access policy

3. Create a api
    - enter a name
    - add a method in '/' resource or create a resource for routes like 'sheets'
    - go to method and go to method request
    - enable api key
    - enable cors
    - deploy the api and give a stage name from Actions
    *******************
    - create a key
    - enter a name
    - keep auto generated    
    *******************
    - create a usage plan
    - Add API stage
    - associated key and api

4. Create a domain for the api
  - go to api gateway and create custom domain
  - put your domain name
  - save and you will get cloudfront url
  - save Base Path Mappings
  - go to Route 53 and search for the domain
  - add a record set for the domain
  - select IPv4 and put alias value as cloudfront url

5. Web hosting of SPA like React
   - disclaimer it will take more than 1.5 hrs to get served on internet via S3 & Cloudfront
   - create AWS S3 bucket with 3 folder (dev, stage, prod) and upload file in one of it
   - in cloudfront
        Origin Domain Name = bucket
        Origin Path = /prod
        Default Root Object = index.html
        Update bucket policy = yes
    (invalidation using => Object Paths /*)
   - Get cloudfront url
   - go to Route53
   - create hosted zone with your domain
   - get dns from aws and put into your registar
   - create record set with IPv4 and cloudfront url
   - create public certificate and add CNAME from there

6. AWS Certificate Manager
    - Create record in Route 53
    - Use the record to create certificate
    - Create CNAME from the certificate
    - Map the certificate in Cloudfront/LB
    
7. SSH to EC2
   - Open an SSH client(Gitbash on winddows).
   - Locate your private key file. The key used to launch this instance is filename.pem
   - Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable.
     chmod 400 filename.pem
   - Connect to your instance using its Public DNS:
     ssh -i "filename.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-22-97-8899.compute-1.amazonaws.com
